# Pyber-Analysis-


## Overview of the Analysis:
The purpose of this project is to create a summary data frame that analyzes the ride sharing data of each city type including urban, rural, and suburban. This will help to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for neighborhoods lacking ride-sharing services. 


## Results:
•	Rural cities possess the least number of drivers, rides, and total fares. 

•	Urban cities have the highest ridership demand as compared to rural and suburban cities.

•	Urban cities have 4x more drivers than suburban cities.

•	Suburban cities have the second most drivers, rides, and total fares. 

•	Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver, though they have the least drivers.  

•	There is a relationship in which fare revenue is higher by city type when there is a larger ratio of drivers to rides.

## Summary:
Based on the analysis above, I would recommend:

•	Increase the number of drivers in Rural areas to ensure there are enough drivers to meet the demand. 

•	Implement charge increases or decreases based off how many riders there are in any of the cities during certain months.

•	Use promotional strategies and incentives to encourage drivers to drive in lacking cities.
